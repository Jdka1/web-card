Currently a senior at the Nueva High School in San Mateo. Creator of @16mmphotos, named after the focal length, 16mm, known for its ability to capture crisp close-up foregrounds and stunning backgrounds in one shot.

<p>
I was inspired to become a photographer in 2019 as I embarked on a road trip from San Francisco to British Columbia and captured nature along the coast with a used camera that was gifted to me. Since then, I have embarked on many mindful expeditions with friends and family including a week-long backpacking trip in Yosemite and summiting Exit Glacier in Alaska.
