    title: "How to Beat Your Scrolling Addiction",
    summary: "My proposal on how to deal with addiction to scrolling platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok by managing accessibility to dopamine.",
    date: "2024-06-28",
    content: <p>
The average teenager spends almost <b>5 hours a day</b> on social media.<br></br><br></br>

In one lifetime, that is more than <b>14.5 years, 6641 miles, or 253 marathons</b> scrolled with your thumbs. <br></br><br></br>

The amount of time we spend on social media is blatantly present but sneaks up on us over time. With platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube, all which have their own addictive video based scrolling platforms, the hours spent on these platforms add up quickly. Not only does this time wasted impact physical health, with eye strain, poor posture, and disrupted sleep patterns, but also mental well-being. Studies have shown correlations between prolonged social media use (doomscrolling) and increased levels of anxiety, depression, and feelings of loneliness, making it clear that there are significant consequences that cannot be ignored. <br></br><br></br>

<b>So how do we beat this addiction?</b> <br></br><br></br>

The problem is the ease of accessibility to dopamine. The problem is not that each Instagram reel or YouTube short we watch is such a revelation that it fuels our brain with a strong hit of dopamine so that we keep coming back—these videos only give us mini hits of dopamine. Our addictions are created due to the ease of accessibility to these small micro-doses of dopamine. Looking at one more TikTok doesn’t actually give more dopamine than finishing a homework assignment, it just is a hit that is much easier to access. Thus, our brain takes the path of least resistance and satisfies its cravings in seconds, rather than having to wait hours to get rewarded with productive dopamine.
<br></br><br></br>

<b>How do we fix this?</b>

<br></br><br></br>
We need to decrease the accessibility to cheap dopamine in our lives. Anything that makes it harder for you to access the free dopamine in the endless seas of content will make you more productive. One parallel of how this can be implemented in our lives is through the Alarmy app, which is an alarm clock that makes you do tasks like solving a math problem or scanning a QR code on the other side of your house to turn it off. I used this app when I had a problem with sleeping in and without fail I would always wake up when I wanted to if snoozing the alarm was inaccessible enough. Maybe something like this could be implemented in our phones so that to open an Instagram reel we have to do a task—something that dissuades us enough to go to something more productive.
<br></br><br></br>
<b>As of now</b>, here are some presently practical solutions that I think could be useful in achieving the same effect:

<blockquote>
Whenever I need to study I put my phone in another room. I never keep it at my workstation/ desk. So if I want to look at my phone, I have to stand up and go to the other room to go and scroll. I usually leave it in places like the kitchen or the bathroom, so there isn’t anywhere really comfortable to sit down to lounge around and scroll.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Uninstall. I don't keep any app on my phone that is non-essential. I don't have social media apps on my phone. Every time I want to go on a social media app, I either have to re-download it or log in on my pc - both are a pain.
</blockquote>
